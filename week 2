1)	Write a program to interchange the largest and the smallest number in an array.
Answer=>

# Python program to interchange the largest and smallest number in an array

# Define the array (list of numbers)
arr = [10, 5, 20, 8, 15]

# Finding the index of the smallest and largest elements
min_index = arr.index(min(arr))  # index of smallest no.
max_index = arr.index(max(arr))  # index of largest no.

#  Print the original array
print("Original array is :", arr)

# Swaping the smallest and largest elements
arr[min_index], arr[max_index] = arr[max_index], arr[min_index]

# Print the updated array
print("Array after swapping largest and smallest:", arr)

2)	In a small company there are five salesmen. Each salesman is supposed to sell three products. Write a program using a 2D array to
    print (i) the total sales by each salesman and (ii) total sales of each item

Answer=>

# Create a 2D array  to store  data
# Rows = 5 salesmen, Columns = 3 products
# Each inner list represents one salesmanâ€™s sales for 3 products
sales = [
    [100, 200, 150],   # Salesman 1
    [80, 120, 100],    # Salesman 2
    [90, 160, 130],    # Salesman 3
    [110, 140, 120],   # Salesman 4
    [95, 105, 125]     # Salesman 5
]

#Print total sales by each salesman
print("Total sales by each salesman:")
for i in range(5):  # Loop through each salesman
    total = sum(sales[i])  # Sum of all products sold by salesman i
    print(f"Salesman {i+1}: {total}")

#Print total sales of each item
print("\nTotal sales of each product:")
for j in range(3):  # Loop through each product
    total = 0
    for i in range(5):  # Loop through each salesman
        total += sales[i][j]  # Add sales of product j by salesman i
    print(f"Product {j+1}: {total}")

3) Write a program to input two m x n matrices and then calculate the sum of their corresponding elements 
  and store it in a third m x n matrix.

Answer=>

# Python code to add two m x n matrices

#  Input the size of the matrices
m = int(input("Enter number of rows (m): "))
n = int(input("Enter number of columns (n): "))

#  Create empty matrices
matrix1 = []
matrix2 = []
sum_matrix = []

#  Input elements for the first matrix
print("\nEnter elements for the first matrix:")
for i in range(m):
    row = []
    for j in range(n):
        val = int(input(f"Enter element at position [{i+1}][{j+1}]: "))
        row.append(val)
    matrix1.append(row)

#  Input elements for the second matrix
print("\nEnter elements for the second matrix:")
for i in range(m):
    row = []
    for j in range(n):
        val = int(input(f"Enter element at position [{i+1}][{j+1}]: "))
        row.append(val)
    matrix2.append(row)

#  Add the two matrix and store the result in sum_matrix
for i in range(m):
    row = []
    for j in range(n):
        # Adding corresponding elements
        row.append(matrix1[i][j] + matrix2[i][j])
    sum_matrix.append(row)

#  Print the result
print("\nSum of the two matrices:")
for row in sum_matrix:
    print(row)

4)	Write a program to read and display a 2 x 2 x 2 array.

Answer=>

# Python program to read and display a 2 x 2 x 2 array

# Create an empty 3D array
array_3d = []

# Read values into the 3D array
print("Enter elements for a 2 x 2 x 2 array:")

for i in range(2):  # Loop for depth (block)
    block = []
    print(f"\nBlock {i+1}:")
    for j in range(2):  # Loop for rows
        row = []
        for k in range(2):  # Loop for columns
            val = int(input(f"Enter element at position [{i+1}][{j+1}][{k+1}]: "))
            row.append(val)
        block.append(row)
    array_3d.append(block)

#  Display the 3D array
print("\nThe 2 x 2 x 2 array is:")

for i in range(2):
    print(f"\nBlock {i+1}:")
    for j in range(2):
        print(array_3d[i][j])  # Print each row

5)	Write a program which illustrates the use of a pointer to a three-dimensional array.

Answer=>

# Python program to show how a "pointer" (reference) works with a 3D array

#  Create a small 3D array (2 blocks, 2 rows, 2 columns)
array = [
    [ [1, 2], [3, 4] ],
    [ [5, 6], [7, 8] ]
]

#  Make another variable that points to the same array
pointer = array  # This is like a pointer (both refer to the same data)

#  Print the array using the pointer
print("Array using pointer:")
print(pointer)

# Change one value using the pointer
pointer[0][0][0] = 99  # Change the first value

#Print the original array to show that it changed
print("\nOriginal array after change through pointer:")
print(array)
